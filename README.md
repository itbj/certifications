# Technical Certifications Study Guides
This repository contains study guides I've put together for various certifications I've studied for.  Each guide comes with no warranty and use it at your own risk.  My recommendation would be to leverage the study guide as a starting point and customize and update it to your individual study needs.

Feel free to update it to address mistakes or changes to the service.

Thanks!
